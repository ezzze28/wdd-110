    <h2>Ezequiel Nicolidakis</h2>
    <h2>Just call me Eze</h2>
    <p>Hey everyone! I´m Eze, from Montevideo, Uruguay and like the most of you finally I´m on my first semester of classes in BYU. I have the goal of getting the web and computer programming certificate to start working as a developer and keep progressing.</p>
    <p>When I´m not studying other things I like to do are ride my bike, travel, take photos, watch soccer, play videogames and listen to music like Frank Ocean, The Weeknd or reggaeton.</p>
    <p>I had the amazing experience of serving as a full-time missionary on two missions!. First I was initially assigned to the Mexico City Northwest mission where I was for 18 months, then COVID-19 came and I came back to my country to serve in the Uruguay Montevideo West Mission.</p>
