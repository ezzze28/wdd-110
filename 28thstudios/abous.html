                <h4>Writing histories and the history. Every big thing ever created or discovered started as an idea, that's why we decided to bring together the most creative minds ever, because we want to tell the greatest stories, and we let you be the main character. Working with technology also allows us to be constantly innovating and creating new solutions and versions of ourselves to deliver the gamers their best time.</h4>

                <p>Started just as a group of friends with a common dream and a goal, to make that dream true. Based in the north of Montevideo, after more than 15 years leading the video game industry, today we can say that the dream is now a reality. Now, there is a company that is worried about not only creating products to sell, instead we give you stories that you star, interactive art.</p>
