      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>Today ́s videogame industry is not focused on giving an enjoyable experience to the player, games 
        are more commercial products than entertaining and interactive pieces of art that allows you to 
        have experiences that you do not use to have in your daily life. 
        Do we still need to have experiences out of our range to feel joy while we are on a gaming 
        session?
        Not exactly, and our “dawg” walking simulator gives you the chance to enjoy a modern game that 
        proposes a normal life situation.
        If you can communicate the product, you can make money off the product, there is where the 
        engage to our game begins, with an engaging and communicative website. </p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>As a videogames company, the main audience for our website are games. Mostly men in a range of 
         age from 14 to 35 (average gamer in the US), that could be a high school student or a father that
         wants to know more about our products. We develop games for desktop as mobile games so our site 
         will cover both of the platforms.  All this is to engage people with information to play and buy
         our games in a sooner future.</p>  <!-- change this -->
